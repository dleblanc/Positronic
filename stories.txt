Upcoming stories to finish:

DEFECT: There is something funky going on with the input to stats, it always comes out at 75 % - too tired to know if that's what the below says. Anywhoo - break out that part, and make it more amenable to testing, perhaps have a method which continues to the next iteration, and have the timer call that, so we can just call that directly.  Wait - since 5/20 is always .25%, it must always be thinking we never make a match (and somehow screwing up/inverting the comparison?)

DEFECT: currently counting non-guesses as matches when the computer creates a non-match. If the user selects when there is no match, it counts negatively, if the computer created a match and the user didn't select it, it counts negatively, if the computer didn't create a match and the user didn't select it, it doesn't count.

TODO: update the selection when the user presses a button.

 - Display success/failure with colour for each type (audible, visual)
 - track statistics for a single game - show total at end
 - show running total as the game progresses
 - support pausing the game
 - support unpausing the game (and make it work after it's backgrounded & restored)
 - make the game always stay up? (or perhaps save it's position?) 
 - auto-change the N back number based upon success statistics
 - unify the duplicated code between sounds and locations. Right now the sound stuff isn't as well tested.
 - provide a visual for the audio portion (if using it in public)?
