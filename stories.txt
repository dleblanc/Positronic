Upcoming stories to finish:

DEFECT: currently counting non-guesses as matches when the computer creates a non-match. If the user selects when there is no match, it counts negatively, if the computer created a match and the user didn't select it, it counts negatively, if the computer didn't create a match and the user didn't select it, it doesn't count.

TODO: update the selection when the user presses a button.

 - Not enough pairs - generate a minimum # of them in the randomized list
 - (related to:) finish the game after M moves
 - Accept keyboard input
 - Display success/failure with colour for each type (audible, visual)
 - support changing the N back number (manually)
 - track statistics for a single game - show total at end
 - show running total as the game progresses
 - support pausing the game
 - support unpausing the game (and make it work after it's backgrounded & restored)
 - make the game always stay up? (or perhaps save it's position?) 
 - auto-change the N back number based upon success statistics
 - unify the duplicated code between sounds and locations. Right now the sound stuff isn't as well tested.
 - provide a visual for the audio portion (if using it in public)?
