Upcoming stories to finish:

 - Display success/failure with colour for each type (audible, visual) - ALSO, display something other than just colour.
 - show running total as the game progresses
 - Display detailed stats - audible guesses/correct, same for position, and % right.
 - support pausing the game
 - support unpausing the game (and make it work after it's backgrounded & restored)
 - make the game always stay up? (or perhaps save it's position?) 
 - auto-change the N back number based upon success statistics
 - unify the duplicated code between sounds and locations. Right now the sound stuff isn't as well tested.
 - provide a visual for the audio portion (if using it in public)?

 - Put the n-back selector, start, pause buttons in the menu.
 - support auto-starting next level
 - scale to full screen and use more interesting animations+colour
 - stick the buttons on the bottom, make em big, colour them differently than the blocks on the screen (use 2d stuff for the screen?)
