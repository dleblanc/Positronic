A dual-n-back game for the Android (android + brain == positronic?).

WORK IN PROGRESS - doesn't do anything yet.

Written in Scala.


To build:

  - Download and install SBT: http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

  - Download and unpack the Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android SDK ('brew install sbt' android-sdk when using homebrew[http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew] on OSX).

  - Set the ANDROID_SDK_HOME environment variable, eg:

    export ANDROID_SDK_HOME=~/Applications/android-sdk-mac_86

  - Install an android platform: launch $ANDROID_SDK_HOME/tools/android, go to 'available packages' install a recent SDK, follow the prompts.
    I installed android 2.2.

  - Get this distribution:
	git clone git@github.com:dleblanc/Positronic.git

  - Grab the dependencies:
	sbt update

  - Build the package:
	sbt package-debug

  - Install it on the emulator:
	sbt reinstall-emulator

 Done!

  - Run the tests:
	sbt test

  - Run the tests everytime a file is changed - you would do this in a separate window while you hack on the code:
	sbt ~test

  - Edit in eclipse:
        sbt eclipse
        import as existing project
